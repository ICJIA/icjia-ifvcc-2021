Family Violence Coordinating Councils, at both the state and local/circuit levels, provide a forum to improve the institutional, professional and community response to family violence including child abuse, domestic abuse, and elder abuse. Councils provide professional education and prevention; coordinate interventions and services for victims and perpetrators; and contribute to both the improvement of the legal system and the administration of justice.

Initiated under the auspices of the Illinois Supreme Court in 1990, Illinois is one of the few states that has a systematically organized, statewide infrastructure that operates at both the state and local levels. Since the 1970â€™s, a comprehensive, coordinated approach to preventing family violence has been promoted as the most efficient and effective way to penetrate systems and mobilize them for the greatest change.
